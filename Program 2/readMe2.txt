PROBLEM STATEMENT:

Given a set of input and demand files (input+demand=instance), find the minimum cost for sending the flow and also find the following:
>Flow out of node 8 on each of it's outgoing link.(Instance 1,2)
>Flow into node 14 on each of it's incoming links. (Instance 3,4)
>Which node has the maximum inflow? (Instance 5)

Compiling Program 2:
g++ -g -o 2 2.cpp

Executing Program 2:
./2 inputFileName.txt demandFileName.txt

-----------------------------------------------------------------
Example:
Instance 1:
./2 input1.txt demand1.txt

Instance 2:
./2 input2.txt demand2.txt

Instance 3:
./2 input3.txt demand3.txt

Instance 4:
./2 input4.txt demand4.txt

Instance 5:
./2 input5.txt demand5.txt
